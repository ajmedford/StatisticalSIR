# StatisticalSIR

Collection of classes for S-I-R epidemiological models with heterogeneous susceptibility.

All classes are defined in SIR.py. Scripts ending in .py demonstrate various functionalities:

- distribution_comparison.py: Compare the number of people infected over time with susceptibility based on different distributions with fixed variance.
- method_comparison.py: Compare the results of different approaches to accounting for heterogeneous susceptibility with the Gamma distribution.
- distribution_dynamics.py: Evaluate the dynamics of the susceptibility distribution for a given initial distribution over time.
- gamma_beta_comparison: Detailed comparison of the distribution dynamics and epidemiological response for susceptibility based on gamma and beta distributions.
